[Wire](wire.com) went to [ZuriHac](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2020/) last
week-end!  With 500 attendants last year, ZuriHac is probably the
biggest event for Haskell enthusiasts, academics, and programmers
world-wide, and not so small compared to software engineering events
in general.  It is a hybrid between hackathon and conference: people
form groups to work on many popular software projects here, but if you
prefer, you can spend most of your day in talks and tutorials and
making friends with people in the hallway.

This year people didn't meet on a [University
Campus](https://www.hsr.ch/) at the Southern shore of Lake Zurich in
Switzerland, but on Discord and on YouTube.

That was a new experience with many possibilities to discover, but
also some challenges.

Live-chatting during the talk was super useful, allowing to clarify
questions and discuss the talk between participants in real-time.
At the same time, it could also distract from the actual presentation,
but luckily one could just rewind the talk a bit when necessary and
then increase the playback speed a bit to catch up again.

Similarly, while in the previous years it had only been possible to
follow one or two conversations at a time (because everything happened
in different rooms),
this time it was much easier to have a look at many of them.
Due to the incredible amount of interesting projects and discussions,
it was really tempting to try following too many things at once.

In the end, it was brilliantly organised and a big success.  Sad that
there was no dip in the lake in the afternoon, and no barbecue at
night, but talks and hacking and networking worked almost as well.
Better in weird ways: easier to focus, easier to hunt down people you
know must be around here somewhere.

The Wire team worked on a couple of things.

Arian worked on [haskell-fido2](http://github.com/arianvp/haskell-fido2).
A haskell library for Webauthn, a new standard for browser authentication
that replaces passwords and/or 2FA codes with unphishable hardware keys.
People can use the TPM in their laptops and phones, or a dedicated hardware
key like [Nitrokey](https://nitrokey.com) and [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com)
to authenticate against websites. This library makes it possible to easily
add this modern authentication scheme to haskell web services.

We hope to use this library in the future to bring two-factor and/or passwordless
authentication to Wire, which has been a highly requested feature.

The library is still very much work in progress. But basic registration
and authentication is now working. Special thanks to Laurens, Ruud and Berdario
for joining this project during the hackathon! We found the Webauthn
standard extremely complex and convoluted, and at times also underspecified.
This is a bit worrying for a security-senstitive standard. Arian is planning
on writing a separate blog post on the project relatively soon, detailing
what what he thinks of the Webauthn specification in its current form
and how he thinks it can be potentially be improved.



[Servant](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant) is a library for
generating rest API servers (mock or with hand-written, type-checked
handlers), application-specific client libraries in many languages,
Swagger docs, and some more that are correct by construction.  One of
the more widely discussed issues is that Servant's type-level
machinery could only model one type of response (eg., `200 found`, but
not any one of `200 found`, `400 bad request`, `404 not found`).  The
user always had to pick one of the possible responses as the default
that is returned, and return all others by throwing exceptions,
without the type-level correctness that makes Servant useful.

We have thought about this [for a
while](https://github.com/wireapp/servant-uverb) now, and during
ZuriHac have turned these ideas into a [pull
request](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/pull/1314) that we
want to release soon.  There will be a longer blog post about this
once it's released.  Thanks @Taneb for spending most of your weekend
on this with @fisx!  :)
